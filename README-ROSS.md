I thoroughly enjoyed working on this technical test and found it to be both challenging and engaging. The opportunity to delve into web development and explore potential improvements for a web page related to annual reports was particularly intriguing.

To enhance the functionality and user experience of the web page, there are several potential improvements that could be implemented:

- A Search Bar: Introducing a search bar would allow users to quickly find specific reports by searching for keywords or phrases related to the content they are interested in. This feature enhances usability and makes navigation more intuitive, particularly as the number of reports increases.
- A Date and Time Filter: Given that the reports are annual, implementing a date and time filter would enable users to easily locate reports from specific years. This filter functionality streamlines the user experience, saving time and effort in searching through the reports manually.
- A Load More Button / Pagination: To prevent the page from becoming excessively long and difficult to navigate, implementing a load more button or pagination system would be beneficial. This approach breaks the content into manageable chunks, improving page load times and overall usability.
- Filter Options: If the reports can be logically categorized based on specific criteria (e.g., business sector, topic), incorporating filter options would allow users to refine their search and access relevant reports more efficiently. By providing filter categories, such as industry sectors or report types, users can tailor their browsing experience to their specific interests.
- I also believe that the <a> tag surrounding the Image should link to one of the annual reports rather linking to its own source image.
- I believe that on Mobile view there should only be a one column view for best user experience.
 
I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this technical test and look forward to hearing back soon.
